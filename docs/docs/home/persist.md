# Persist Data
NemesisDB is an in-memory/cache database. This offers performance benefits but it also means if the server shutdowns all the data is lost.

Keys can be persisted to the filesystem and restored on startup or at runtime.

More details are available in [Persist](/tutorials/persist-data/overview).
