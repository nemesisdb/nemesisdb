# Clients

NemesisDB runs a WebSocket server to accept queries.

The default host and port are `127.0.0.1:1987`, but these can be changed in the [config](./config).


If you just want a quick play without coding, you can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) which supports WebSocket clients.
